# Requirements_Tracing
Programming assignment to compare nonfunctional requirements list to functional requirements list using Jaccard index

### Using this program

To use this requirements tracing application there must be 2 folders, labeled (`inputs`) and (`outputs`) on the C:/ directory. This can optionally be changed from within [Processor.cs](https://github.com/barlowtj48/Requirements_Tracing/blob/master/RE_Comparison/Processor.cs)

The inputs must include at least 1 NFR (Nonfunctional Requirement), and at least 1 FR (Functional Requirement). Notated as follows: 

```sh
NFR1 (Operational): description here
FR1: description here
```

An example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/barlowtj48/Requirements_Tracing/blob/master/RE_Comparison/inputs/Run1-input.txt)
